## 3D model construction of mechanical and electronic components

<div style="text-align: justify"> I constructed 3D models of mechanical and electronic components for manufacturing and education purposes by using Computer-Aided Design software (SolidWorks and AUTODESK Inventor). This is the work I performed during the internship (June 2018 - August 2018) at DKS PRODUCTION AND TRADING Co., Ltd, Vietnam. </div>
