##  Navigation of Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGV) using multiple vision-based algorithms.

I joined the designing an analog control system of AGV in industrial environments using CAN-bus.
This is the work I performed during the internship (March 2019 - May 2019) at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST). The project was under the cooperation between the UBIQELIFE Technology Corporation and the Center for Intelligent Robots (NTUST).
